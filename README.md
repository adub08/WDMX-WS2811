# WDMX-WS2811
This is the project home for the WDMX WS2811 controller. It's primarily designed for use as a wearable controller.
It Make's use of lib_dmx and FastLED ardunio libaries . It could in theroy be used to support non standard DMX protocals such as DMX1000K and other non-standard, high channel count DMX protocals. 
	
	Hardware Specs:
	•	Industry Standard wireless solution’s W-DMX header (compatible with internal or external antenna Nano boards & 2.4 or 5.8ghz)
	•	Standard WS2811 digital LEDs (and software upgradable to almost any NRZ [non-return-to-zero] digital LED protocol)
	•	5v or 7-24v DC input
	•	Battery voltage check mode
	•	Wired DMX input option
	•	Internal Temperature sensor
	•	Wired or Wireless RDM (Not implemented in software)
	•	Full SPI integration with the WDMX module (Not implemented in software)
	•	3 General Purpose digital I/O pins (2 interrupt compatible) with settable integrated hardware pull-ups, 1 ADC input pin
	•	2 LED headers (1 of which connects directly to the WDMX module)
	• 	Simple ardunio-compadible ISP programming
