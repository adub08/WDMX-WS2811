  "body": "This is the project home for the WDMX WS2811 controller. \r\nIt's primarily designed for use as a wearable ws2812 controller. My current software for it is ardunio IDE based, and makes use of the lib_dmx and FastLED libraries.  It could in theory be used to support non standard DMX protocols such as DMX1000K and other non-standard, high channel count protocols (although this is completely untested). \r\nPhotos of use: [Here](http://alex.woodnet.net.au/set-electrics-2/)\r\n\r\n![Hardware Pinout](http://alex.woodnet.net.au/wp-content/gallery/stage_electrics/pinout.png)\r\n![Board Dimensions](http://alex.woodnet.net.au/wp-content/gallery/stage_electrics/board.png)\r\nHardware Specs: \r\n*  Industry Standard wireless solution’s W-DMX header (compatible with internal or external antenna Nano boards & 2.4 or 5.8ghz) \r\n*  Standard WS2811 digital LEDs (and software modifiable to any NRZ [non-return-to-zero] digital LED protocol) • 5v or 7-24v DC input \r\n*  Battery voltage check mode \r\n*  Wired DMX input option \r\n*  Internal Temperature sensor \r\n*  Wired or Wireless RDM (Not implemented in software) \r\n*  Full SPI integration with the WDMX module (Not implemented in software) \r\n*  3 General Purpose digital I/O pins (2 interrupt compatible) with integrated hardware pull-ups & 1 ADC input pin. \r\n*  2 LED headers (1 of which connects directly to the WDMX module)\r\n\r\nSoftware To-do List:\r\n* Move away from the Ardunio IDE & bootloader in order to optimise power usage and startup time\r\n* Implement SPI control of the WDMX module\r\n* Implement RDM (battery voltage, ATMEGA temp sensor, DMX addressing,  Pixel type, Colour order, Pixel count, WDMX unlink, WDMX signal strength, Channel selection override)\r\n* Test DMX1000k over DMX & WDMX.\r\n    \r\n\r\n",
